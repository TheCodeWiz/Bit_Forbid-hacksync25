    "# Stress and Achievement, Prediction Plus Prescription\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is twofold: with a given user’s inputs predict what their level of achievement and daily stress is, and then make recommendations on what they can change to improve their level of stress and achievement. Model building and training were handled with Keras/TensorFlow in a prior notebook so that this notebook could simply load the model and perform inference for a given user in minimal time. The dataset used to train the model is the Lifestile and Wellbeing dataset on Kaggel ( https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data ).\n",
    "\n",
    "When this notebook is run it will ask the user for a series of inputs relating to the survey questions from the training dataset. These inputs will be used to create a dataframe, the first row of the dataframe (index 'Actual') will be the user’s inputs, then it will generates additional dataframe rows keeping all the user inputs the same except incrementing/decrementing one element by one (the index label states the change). This dataframe will be fed to the model for predictions. This way a user can observe how a small lifestyle change could impact their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimers: Correlation and causation are not the same, the recommendations this notebook generates may not have the expected impact. While this model is able to accurately approximate the level of daily stress, it is less precise with achievement. Achievement most likely has some confounding variables involved, so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. My recommendation would be to look at the predictions for achievement under 'Actual' and if they accurately reflect your current state then I would imagine the predictions given slight changes would also stay similarly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub link for the project, including training notebook and model: https://github.com/Neil-Kloper/Stress-and-Achievement-Prediction-Plus-Prescription\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks Yvon Dalat ( https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat ) for making the dataset public in the first place and for updating the dataset so I could improve my models performance."
